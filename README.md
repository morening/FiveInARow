## Current Implementation
```
1. Human hand first and then Computer make decision to move based on MiniMax algorithm
2. Create game tree within 3 depth and evaluate the score(= computer's score - human's score)
3. By Alpha-Beta Pruning, it could spend less time to make decision
```

## Promotion In Future
```
As gaming goes on, it will need more nodes to explore larger space.
So it will lead to much slower computation and more memory.
It will occur OOM exception when creating game tree within 5 depth.
I will make much more effort to protmote it.
